            Multi-Agent System research has progressed over the last few years, and several effective applications of this technology are already in
            practice. The recently developed AI system design in the form of a multi-agent system (MAS) has the ability to mitigate the challenges
            posed by social bias and lead to more accurate decision-making, irrespective of the task difficulty. The internationally Conference on
            Multi-Agent Systems for Collaborative Intelligence 2024 (ICMSCI 2024) provides an international forum to present and discuss about the
            most recent research innovations and their effective applications, as well as the evaluation of the approach's impact and enable
            technology transfer. ICMSCI 2024 aims to present, discuss, and disseminate the latest developments and the most important outcomes related
            to real-world collaborative applications. It provides a unique opportunity to bring multi-disciplinary experts, academicians and research
            practitioners together to exchange their experience in the development and deployment of Multi-Agent Systems and promote agent-oriented
            approach and tools to solve the potential challenges in collaborative applications.

          Nepal adopted the multi-university concept in 1983. The idea of Pokhara University (PU) was conceived in 1986; however, it was established
          only in 1997 under the Pokhara University Act, 1997. The Incumbent Honorable Prime Minister and the Honorable Minister for Education of the
          Federal Democratic Republic Nepal are the Chancellor and the Pro-Chancellor, respectively. The Chancellor appoints the Vice Chancellor, the
          principal executive officer of the university. The Registrar is designated to assist him/her in financial management and general
          administration. A non-profit autonomous institution, PU is partly funded by the Government of Nepal and partly by revenues from its students
          and affiliated colleges.

          critical thinking skills, develop positive attitude to work, and enhance competitiveness. Pokhara University, the youngest university system
          operating full-fledged programs in the country, aims at producing human resources capable of working for the nation as well as the global
          community.

        <div class="side-heading">Financing</div>
        <div class="mb-6">
          Pokhara University manages its expenditures mainly from three sources: Nepal Government’s grants, revenue from students and affiliated
          institutions. PU has been gradually reducing its dependence on government coffer in line with Nepal Government’s fiscal policy of
          cost-effective sharing with private sectors. However, it fully depends on government grants for financing the capital expenditure,
          especially on building infrastructures for academic and administrative purposes. With the local community-endowed land, PU provides spaces
          for Schools and Research Centers included in the University Plan. PU credits donors and contributors involved in the construction of
          infrastructures, such as hostel, library, stadium, and auditorium.
