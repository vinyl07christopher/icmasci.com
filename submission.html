            journal.
          </li>
          <li>Multiple submissions from the same corresponding author will not be encouraged.</li>
          <li>
            Maximum a manuscript can include 6 authors, wherein all author related information â€“ name, affiliation, and contact details should be
            mentioned only in the first page, and any information conveying identification of the author(s) must be removed from the manuscript.
          </li>

            notices, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
